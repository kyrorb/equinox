#### What is Equinox?
Equinox is a calculator that can perform multiple functions out of the box. Whether it be trigonometry, fractions or just simple addition and subtraction - we've got you. Additionally, you can "grab" external packages that allow you to expand the range of functions that Equinox can perform!

#### What do you mean by "modular"?
You can get packages made from the community or perhaps even later expansions to Equinox by installing them! After this, the package will be installed into Equinox and can be activated. An example of this would be "eBinary" - allowing you to convert binary to denary and vice-versa.

#### Why should I choose you?
While the interface may not quite be ready yet - we provide speed that is very difficult to match. As well as this, the modularity makes Equinox a product that leaves no bounds.

#### Message from the Creator
Hey! You're most likely here because you wanted a free solution for your work. I know how that feels. Many hours were spent finding a reliable calculator that would do anything I asked. I wanted to change this - so I brought you Equinox. While this software is (in my view), very useful - it is also a passion project for me, and it would not feel right if I was to charge for this. Therefore, I pledge that Equinox will **always be free**.

### Happy Calculating!
